# Ultimate New Software Project Decision Checklist

When starting a new software project, there are many decisions that need to be made. Every decision can be phrased as a question. The following checklist outlines the questions that should be asked, and answered, as early in the life of a new software project as possible.

And now, the list!

## Who

- Who is on the team (and what are their roles)?
- Who is ultimately responsible for the project (management owner)?

## Communication

- How will/does the team communicate?

  - Are there other long-lived branches (per release, per feature, etc)?
- What process is envisioned for accepting commits?
  - Pull requests?
  - Approvals required?
  - Automated build/test pass required?
  - What team members have admin access?
- What build/deploy automation tools does the app use?

## Where
